## 📌 Problem Statement

**ReWear – Community Clothing Exchange**

Develop **ReWear**, a web-based platform that empowers users to exchange unused clothing through either direct swaps or a point-based redemption system.

### Key Objectives:
- Enable users to upload clothing items they no longer use  
- Allow users to browse and claim items listed by others  
- Implement a dual exchange mechanism:  
  - 1️⃣ **Direct Swap** between users  
  - 2️⃣ **Point-Based System** for earning and redeeming points  
- Build a user-friendly interface and scalable backend using **Odoo 16**
